# Getting_data_and_Cleaning_data_week4
This repository was created to finish the assignment for week 4 of Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course.

Step 1: download and unzip the data file into your R working directory. 
Step 2:, download the R source code into your R working directory. Step 3:, execute R source code to generate tidy data file.

## Data description
1.The variables in the data X are sensor signals measured with waist-mounted smartphone from 30 subjects.
2.The variable in the data Y indicates activity type the subjects performed during recording.

## Tidydata
The the final data set contains variables calculated based on mean and standard deviation.

## Code was wriiten based on the following instructions:
create a R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. 
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set. 
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
